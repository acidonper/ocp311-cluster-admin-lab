# Setting Quotas

A resource quota, defined by a ResourceQuota object, provides constraints that limit aggregate resource consumption per project. It can limit the quantity of objects that can be created in a project by type, as well as the total amount of compute resources and storage that may be consumed by resources in that project.

-   Maximum number of pods: 1
-   Maximun resources in a request range:
    -   CPU 1
    -   Memory 500Mi 
    -   Required Storage 50Gi
-   Maximum resource in a limit range:
    -   CPU 2
    -   Memory 2Gi
-   Maximum number of persistentvolumeclaims: 1
-   Maximum number of imagestreams: 5
-   Maximum number of secrets: 5
-   Maximum number of configmaps: 5

### Solution
